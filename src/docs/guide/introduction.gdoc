The "Facebook Platform":http://developers.facebook.com/ is a set of APIs that make your application more social. Read more about "integrating Facebook with your web site":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web on the Facebook developer site.

This project contains the open source *Facebook SDK Grails Plugin* that allows you to integrate the "Facebook Platform":http://developers.facebook.com/ on a website/app powered by "Grails":http://grails.org .

This plugin is a port of the official "Facebook PHP SDK V3.1.1":http://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk to "Grails 2.0":http://grails.org .

It supports the latest *OAuth2.0 authentication* (required since October 1st 2011).

*Facebook SDK Grails Plugin* provides Grails artefacts:

* @FacebookAppService@ - A service to build "apps on Facebook.com":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/ and "websites with the Facebook Platform":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web .
* @FacebookGraphClient@ - A client to call "Facebook Graph API":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/, which is a wrapper around the rock solid "RestFB java library":http://restfb.com/ version 1.6.9 (released October 21, 2011).
* @FacebookJSTagLib@ - A collection of tags to easily integrate "Facebook JS SDK":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/ in your GSPs.
